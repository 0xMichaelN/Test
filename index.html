            <h2>A team of passionate community builders are bringing 8,000 MetaWomen NFTs to the Ethereum blockchain.</h2>     
            <p>The MetaWomenNFT2 collection will represent all women from different walks of life: artists, photographers, marketers, 
                coders, business women, and free-thinkers. These women represent different nationalities, personalities, and sexualities. 
                Every woman and man is welcome and invited to join the MetaWomenNFT2 project and support our mission.                
            <br>
            <br>
            The project's mission is to build on the skills women already possess and help them take advantage of new digital 
            opportunities that are becoming available in the market of Web-3 and the development of the Metaverse. Web-2 skills 
            such as sales, clerical, managerial, web development often times just need upskilling to enable a candidate to become 
            qualified for a Web-3 career.  
            <br>
            <br>
            The MetaWomenNFT2 team believes that with the right support and training, everyday women and men can 
            change the direction of their career path into the digital world.  The team will use the virtual MetaClub to 
            provide both of the needed resources free of charge to the members.
